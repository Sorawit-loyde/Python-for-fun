The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
The early bird catches the worm.
Practice makes perfect, so keep typing every day.
All that glitters is not gold.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
